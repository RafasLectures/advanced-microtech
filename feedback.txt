Previously I had memory problems because I had the wrong device in my project. I had the msp430g2253 instead of g2553 :)

This project was fun to do. It was nice to use the I2C. I had a little problem on the beginning when I had the ScanaStudio
sampling rate too low, then it seemed that my clock was misconfigured and the decoder of the tool didn't work properly.
It took me like 2 hours to find out that my code was correct, but my setup to check the implementation was wrong.
