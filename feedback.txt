Very nice Exercise.

Unfortunately I am having this issue where it doesnt go back to low power mode because every some milliseconds (between 20ms and 150ms, it varies) my readings
from the Accelerometer are all -64 (clearly an error), but I cannot explain why this happens. I tried to check with the IKA logic, but I cannot trigger
in the point where this happens. I think it could be something with the I2C, but I couldn't find it yet.

I also didn't understand what it was meant by the bubble... In my head I would have to use the custom characters anyways. But its fine (I could've also checked the
ilias forum).

Next week I plan to go to the in-person session, maybe I can ask someone there to take a look, or maybe use an oscilloscope with an I2C decoder
and add the message I want to debug, so I can trigger at that spot. Unfortunately I wasn't able to be there last thursday (15.06) because of work.
